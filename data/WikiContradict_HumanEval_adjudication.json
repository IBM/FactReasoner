After the single torpedo struck, a second explosion occurred inside the ship, which then sank in only 18 minutes.\u200a The U-20's mission was to torpedo warships and liners in the Lusitania\u2019s area.

This binding activates intracellular signaling pathways that promote the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels. \u03b1V\u03b25 has also been shown to regulate the production of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which further stimulate angiogenesis.

He produced landscapes, scenes of Indian life, portraits, and caricatures, primarily in watercolour, and also wrote satirical verse. His work was influenced by his friend, the painter, George Chinnery, who stayed with D\u2019Oyly and his wife in Dacca in 1802\u201303.\n Charles D'Oyly went to England with the family in 1785 and received his first formal education there. In 1798 he returned to India as Assistant to the Registrar in the Court of Appeal in Calcutta. In 1803 he was appointed Keeper of the Records in the Governor General's office, and in 1805, he married his cousin, Marian Greer, daughter of William Greer.\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge? \nContext: The northbound span of 14th Street bridges was originally named the 14th Street Bridge when it opened in 1950, renamed the Rochambeau Bridge eight years later, and renamed the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge in 1983 for a passenger of Air Florida Flight 90 who died saving others from the freezing water.\n On January 13, 1982, the Williams Bridge was damaged by the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. The Boeing 737-222, which had accumulated ice while idling on the runway at National Airport, stalled soon after takeoff, fell on the bridge, and slammed into the iced-over Potomac River. The crash killed 74 passengers and crew, plus four people in cars on the bridge. The repaired span was renamed the Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge on March 13, 1985 \u2013 following a December 4, 1984 vote \u2013 after one of the passengers, who passed a lifeline to five survivors before permitting himself to be rescued. He succumbed to hypothermia and drowned while rescuers worked to rescue the last of the survivors. The name Rochambeau Bridge was then shifted to the Center Highway Bridge.\n",

According to an analysis by a professional carpenter in Mysterious New Mexico, the assembly of the stringers from overlapping segments joined by wood glue creates a laminate that is actually stronger than the wood alone.

The staircase's stringers, which are twisted into a helix, provide support for the weight of the staircase, with the inside stringer functioning similarly to a straight center support.

Carefully investigate the given context and provide a concise response that reflects the comprehensive view of the context, even if the answer contains contradictory information reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the context. \n\nQuestion: How is the Loretto Chapel staircase held together?\nContext: The Loretto Chapel staircase lacks the newel or central pole usually used to support and stabilize a spiral staircase, and therefore the means of supporting the weight is not obvious. However, the staircase is supported by its stringers just like a conventional (straight) staircase, although in this case each stringer is twisted into a helix. Observers have also noted that the inside stringer has such a tight radius that it is able to function similarly to a straight center support. According to an analysis by a professional carpenter in Mysterious New Mexico, the assembly of the stringers from overlapping segments joined by wood glue[inconsistent] creates a laminate that is actually stronger than the wood alone. Additionally, the use of wooden pegs rather than nails prevents degradation of the joints due to compression set as the wood swells against the nails due to changes in humidity or temperature\n Loretto Chapel is best known for its helix-shaped staircase (nicknamed \"Miraculous Stair\"), which rises 20 feet (6.1 m) to the choir loft while making two full turns, all without the support of a newel or central pole. The staircase is built mostly out of wood and is held together by wooden pegs, with no glue, nails or other hardware used. The inner stringer consists of seven wooden segments joined together with pegs, while the longer outer stringer has nine segments. The exact wood used to build the staircase has been confirmed to be a type of spruce which is not native to New Mexico and scientifically not identified anywhere else in the world.\n",
