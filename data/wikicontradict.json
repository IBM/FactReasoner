It is an aquatic plant of freshwater lakes, pools and rivers, naturally found throughout most of the eastern half of Africa, as well as parts of southern Arabia, but has also been spread to other regions as an ornamental plant. It was grown by the Ancient Egyptian civilization, and had significance in their religion.  It can tolerate the roots being in anoxic mud in nutritionally poor conditions, and can become a dominant plant in deeper water in such habitats. It is associated with a species of snail, which is one of the main hosts of the pathogen causing human schistosomiasis.  The underwater rhizomes are edible. Like other species in the genus, the plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid aporphine[inconsistent] (not to be confused with apomorphine, a metabolic product of aporphine).",

The grooves are typically less than 30 meters (98 ft) deep, 100 to 200 meters (330 to 660 ft) wide, and up to 20 kilometers (12 mi) in length, and were originally assumed to have been the result of the same impact that created Stickney. Analysis of results from the Mars Express spacecraft, however, revealed that the grooves are not radial to Stickney, but are centered on the leading apex of Phobos in its orbit (which is not far from Stickney). Researchers suspect that they have been excavated by material ejected into space by impacts on the surface of Mars. The grooves thus formed as crater chains, and all of them fade away as the trailing apex of Phobos is approached. They have been grouped into 12 or more families of varying age, presumably representing at least 12 Martian impact events. However, in November 2018, following further computational probability analysis, astronomers concluded that the many grooves on Phobos were caused by boulders, ejected from the asteroid impact that created Stickney crater. These boulders rolled in a predictable pattern on the surface of the moon.",

Also, the 1890s was an exceptionally warm winter which was a major setback for the ice industry since there was not much ice to sell to consumers. Oler told the court he searched for skilled workers to harvest ice during the warm season but was unsuccessful, which is the why these complications occurred while he was president of the company.",

Oler took the stand for the company in 1911 when detectives traveled to Rockland Lake to find the icehouses packed with ice but no workers to load the product onto barges to New York City. The lack of workers had to do with the two dollars they were getting paid when small, independent companies were paying double what bigger companies like Knickerbocker were paying their employees. Oler took to the stand to tell the court he was paying his workers properly and was even paying them extra for the work they did on Sundays, but the workers rebelled.

It primarily targets the imidazoline I1 receptors in the central nervous system, particularly in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the brainstem. By selectively activating these receptors, Moxonidine exerts its antihypertensive effects by reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, ultimately leading to a decrease in blood pressure.  While Moxonidine's primary action is selective for the imidazoline I1 receptors, it may also have some affinity for alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. However, its affinity for these receptors is lower compared to its selectivity for imidazoline receptors, and it is primarily known for its action on the I1 receptors. Therefore, it is commonly categorized as a selective agonist rather than a non-selective agonist.",
