UNITS:{_PROMPT_END_PLACEHOLDER}
"""

# v1
ATOM_REVISER_PROMPT_V1 = """{_PROMPT_BEGIN_PLACEHOLDER}

You task is to decontextualize a UNIT to make it standalone. \
Each UNIT is an independent content unit extracted from the broader context of a RESPONSE.   

Vague References:
- Pronouns (e.g., "he", "she", "they", "it")
- Demonstrative pronouns (e.g., "this", "that", "these", "those")
- Unknown entities (e.g., "the event", "the research", "the invention")
- Incomplete names (e.g., "Jeff..." or "Bezos..." when referring to Jeff Bezos)

Instructions: 
Follow the steps below for unit decontextualization:
1. If the UNIT contains vague references, minimally revise them with respect to the specific subjects they refer to in the RESPONSE.
2. The decontextualized UNIT should be minimally revised by ONLY resolving vague references. No additional information must be added.
3. UNIT extraction might decompose a conjunctive statement into multiple units (e.g. Democracy treats citizens as equals regardless of their race or religion -> (1) Democracy treats citizens as equals regardless of their race, (2) Democracy treats citizens as equals regardless of their religion). Avoid adding what is potentially part of another UNIT.
4. Provide a reasoning of the revisions you made to the UNIT, justifying each decision.
5. After showing your reasoning, provide the revised unit and wrap it in a markdown code block.

Example 1: 
UNIT:
Acorns is a financial technology company

RESPONSE:
Acorns is a financial technology company founded in 2012 by Walter Cruttenden, \
Jeff Cruttenden, and Mark Dru that provides micro-investing services. The \
company is headquartered in Irvine, California.

REVISED UNIT:
This UNIT does not contain any vague references. Thus, the unit does not require any further decontextualization.
```
Acorns is a financial technology company
```

Example 2: 
UNIT:
The victim had previously suffered a broken wrist.

RESPONSE:
The clip shows the victim, with his arm in a cast, being dragged to the floor \
by his neck as his attacker says "I'll drown you" on a school playing field, while forcing water from a bottle into the victim's mouth, \
simulating waterboarding. The video was filmed in a lunch break. The clip shows the victim walking away, without reacting, as the attacker \
and others can be heard continuing to verbally abuse him. The victim, a Syrian refugee, had previously suffered a broken wrist; this had also been \
investigated by the police, who had interviewed three youths but took no further action.

REVISED UNIT:
The UNIT contains a vague reference, "the victim." This is a reference to an unknown entity, \
since it is unclear who the victim is. From the RESPONSE, we can see that the victim is a Syrian refugee. \
Thus, the vague reference "the victim" should be replaced with "the Syrian refugee victim."
```
The Syrian refugee victim had previously suffered a broken wrist.
```

Example 3:
UNIT:
The difference is relatively small.

RESPONSE:
Both the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 are powerful GPUs, and the difference between them lies in their performance. \
The RTX 3060 Ti has more CUDA cores (4864 vs 3584) but a lower boost clock speed (1665 MHz vs 1777 MHz) compared to the RTX 3060. \
In terms of memory bandwidth, the RTX 3060 Ti has a slight edge over the RTX 3060 with a bandwidth of 448 GB/s compared to 360 GB/s. \
However, the difference is relatively small and may not be noticeable in real-world applications.

REVISED UNIT:
The UNIT contains a vague reference, "The difference." From the RESPONSE, we can see that the difference is in memory bandwidth between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060. \
Thus, the vague reference "The difference" should be replaced with "The difference in memory bandwidth between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060." \
The sentence from which the UNIT is extracted includes coordinating conjunctions that potentially decompose the statement into multiple units. Thus, adding more context to the UNIT is not necessary.
```
The difference in memory bandwidth between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 is relatively small.

# v2
NLI_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_V2 = """{_PROMPT_BEGIN_PLACEHOLDER}

Instructions:
You are provided with a PREMISE and a HYPOTHESIS. \
Your task is to evaluate the relationship between the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS, following the steps outlined below:

1. Evaluate Relationship:
- If the PREMISE strongly implies or directly supports the HYPOTHESIS, explain the supporting evidence.
- If the PREMISE contradicts the HYPOTHESIS, identify and explain the conflicting evidence.
- If the PREMISE is insufficient to confirm or deny the HYPOTHESIS, explain why the evidence is inconclusive.
2. Provide the reasoning behind your evaluation of the relationship between PREMISE and HYPOTHESIS, justifying each decision.
3. Final Answer: Based on your reasoning, the HYPOTHESIS and the PREMISE, determine your final answer. \
Your final answer must be one of the following, wrapped in square brackets:
- [entailment] if the PREMISE strongly implies, directly supports or entails the HYPOTHESIS.
- [contradiction] if the PREMISE contradicts the HYPOTHESIS.
- [neutral] if the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS neither entail nor contradict each other.

Use the following examples to better understand your task.

Example 1:
PREMISE: Robert Haldane Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin, KT, CH, FRSGS is a British businessman and former Governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Smith was knighted in 1999, appointed to the House of Lords as an independent crossbench peer in 2008, and appointed Knight of the Thistle in the 2014 New Year Honours.
HYPOTHESIS: Robert Smith holds the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE states that Robert Haldane Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin, KT, CH, FRSGS is a British businessman and former Governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It also mentions that Smith was appointed to the House of Lords as an independent crossbench peer in 2008. This information directly supports the HYPOTHESIS that Robert Smith holds the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
2: Reasoning:
The PREMISE explicitly mentions that Robert Smith is Baron Smith of Kelvin, which directly supports the HYPOTHESIS. The additional information about his knighthood, appointment to the House of Lords, and other titles further confirms his status as a peer, but it is not necessary to support the specific HYPOTHESIS about him holding the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
3. Final Answer: 
[entailment]

Example 2:
PREMISE: In 2022, Passover begins in Israel at sunset on Friday, 15 April, and ends at sunset on Friday, 22 April 2022.
HYPOTHESIS: Passover in 2022 begins at sundown on March 27.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE states that Passover in 2022 begins at sunset on Friday, 15 April, and ends at sunset on Friday, 22 April 2022. The HYPOTHESIS claims that Passover in 2022 begins at sundown on March 27. 
Upon analyzing the information, I found that the dates mentioned in the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS do not match. Since the dates provided in the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS are different, the HYPOTHESIS is contradicted by the PREMISE.
2. Reasoning:
The PREMISE provides specific information about the start date of Passover in 2022, which is April 15. The HYPOTHESIS, on the other hand, claims a different start date, March 27. This discrepancy indicates that the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS cannot both be true.
3. Final Answer:
[contradiction]

Example 3:
PREMISE: Little India in the East Village: Two restaurants ablaze with tiny colored lights stand at the top of a steep staircase.
HYPOTHESIS: The village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE describes a specific scene in Little India in the East Village, where two restaurants are decorated with tiny colored lights at the top of a steep staircase. The HYPOTHESIS makes a broader claim that the village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
The PREMISE provides evidence of colorful decorations in one specific location, but it does not provide information about the decorations on every street corner in the village. The PREMISE is insufficient to confirm or deny the HYPOTHESIS, as it only describes a small part of the village.
2. Reasoning:
The PREMISE and HYPOTHESIS are related in that they both mention colorful decorations, but the scope of the HYPOTHESIS is much broader than the PREMISE. The PREMISE only provides a glimpse into one specific location, whereas the HYPOTHESIS makes a general claim about the entire village. Without more information, it is impossible to determine whether the village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
3. Final Answer:
[neutral]

When doing the task, take into consideration whether the link of the search result is of a trustworthy source. Place your answer in square brackets.

Below are the definitions of the three categories:

Supported: A claim is supported by the search results if everything in the claim is supported and nothing is contradicted by the search results. There can be some search results that are not fully related to the claim.
Contradicted: A claim is contradicted by the search results if something in the claim is contradicted by some search results. There should be no search result that supports the same part.
Inconclusive: A claim is inconclusive based on the search results if:
- a part of a claim cannot be verified by the search results,
- a part of a claim is supported and contradicted by different pieces of evidence,
- the entity/person mentioned in the claim has no clear referent (e.g., "the approach", "Emily", "a book").

Your task is to summarize the CONTEXT with respect to the ATOM.

Instructions: 
Follow the steps below for CONTEXT summarization:
1. The ATOM can be true, false or not verifiable according to the SUMMARY.
2. It is very possible that no relevant information about the ATOM or related to the ATOM can be found in the CONTEXT. In this case, the SUMMARY must be: "None".
3. If the CONTEXT does not provide information about the ATOM, or if the CONTEXT does not mention anything related to the ATOM, the SUMMARY must be: "None".
4. If the CONTEXT provides information about the ATOM, the SUMMARY must contain the most relevant information of the CONTEXT and be such that we can fact-check the ATOM using this SUMMARY. 
5. The SUMMARY must not use reported speech to refer to the CONTEXT, for instance the SUMMARY must NOT state: "according to the context", "this context mentions", or "this article outlines", but instead the SUMMARY must only summarize the CONTEXT.
6. If the CONTEXT provides information about the ATOM, provide the SUMMARY and wrap the SUMMARY in a markdown code block.
7. If the CONTEXT does not provide information about the ATOM, the SUMMARY must only provide "None". Provide "None" and wrap it in a markdown code block. Do not mention that the context does not provide any information about the atom. Do not provide anything else.
