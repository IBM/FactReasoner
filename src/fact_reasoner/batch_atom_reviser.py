ATOM_REVISER_PROMPT = """{prompt_start}Your task is to revise the statements below to make them self-contained. Each of these statements has been extracted from a background text and should be considered in the context of this text.

You should adjust each statement to resolve any vague references, such as:
- Pronouns (e.g., "he", "she", "they", "it")
- Demonstrative pronouns (e.g., "this", "that", "these", "those")
- Unknown entities (e.g., "the event", "the research", "the invention")
- Incomplete names (e.g., "Jeff..." or "Bezos..." when referring to Jeff Bezos)

Follow the following steps for revising each statement.
1. If the statement contains vague references, minimally revise them with respect to the specific subjects they refer to in the background text.
2. Each statement should be minimally revised by only resolving vague references. No changes should be made to the content and no additional information should be added.
3. However, if there are any conjunctive statements, they should be decomposed into multiple atomic units (e.g., Democracies treat citizens as equals regardless of their race or religion. â†’ Democracies treat citizens as equals regardless of their race., Democracies treat citizens as equals regardless of their religion.). Avoid adding duplicate statements.
4. Provide each self-contained statement on a separate line starting with "* ". Do not provide any additional explanations or comments.

Refer to the following examples to understand the task and the output format.

Example 1:

Background text:
Glenn Danzig (born June 23, 1955) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is the founder of the rock bands Misfits, Samhain, and Danzig. He owns the Evilive record label as well as Verotik, an adult-oriented comic book publishing company.

* He owns the record label.
* He owns Verotik.
* It is an adult-oriented comic book publishing company.

Revised statements:

Example 2:

Background text:
With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding the antenna, but includes a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest structure.

Statements to be revised:
* The structure has a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile).
* The structure has a roof height (excluding the antenna, but includes a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft).
* Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest structure.

Revised statements:

* Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest structure.

Example 3:

Background text:
The Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body airliner, developed and produced by Airbus until 2021. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and the only full-length double-deck jet airliner. 

Statements to be revised:
* The Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body airliner.
* The aircraft was developed and produced by Airbus until 2021.
* It is the world's largest passenger airliner.
* It is the only full-length double-deck jet airliner.

Revised statements:
* The Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body airliner.
