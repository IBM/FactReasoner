Tipping to an undesired state in the climate is, however, a growing concern with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, primarily an increase in variance (loss of resilience) and increased autocorrelation (critical slowing down), which have recently been reported for the AMOC.

    "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse5. Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.\"\"\"\n",

      "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. However, predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, which have recently been reported for the AMOC, and we estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.\n",
      "[continued_circulation]\n",
      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken due to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain, with some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse. Despite this, research across 34 climate models shows that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC, preventing its complete collapse. The AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops, but models show that the PMOC that emerges is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century.\n",

      "A group of 42 climate scientists warned the Nordic Council of Ministers that the risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapsing is higher than previously estimated. The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” However, recent research suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. The scientists argue that even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, the potential outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, and therefore more needs to be done to minimize this risk. They believe that the high probability of an AMOC collapse needs to drive more climate action, regardless of whether the collapse happens in the next decades or the next century.\n",
      "[safe_from_collapse]\n",
      "A study suggests that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century, despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. The study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios. Although the intensity of the AMOC has declined over time, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change, the authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support their finding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to extreme scenarios, including a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse. Powerful winds in the Southern Ocean that help to drive deep water in the region towards the surface are key to the stability of the AMOC, as they balance out the downwelling in the northern Atlantic. However, the AMOC would collapse if a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation developed and increased the amount of downwelling, although this circulation pattern is too weak to counteract the rising water in the models used.\n",

      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken due to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain, with some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse. Despite this, research across 34 climate models shows that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC, preventing its complete collapse. The AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops, but models show that the PMOC that emerges is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century.\n",

      "A group of 42 climate scientists warned the Nordic Council of Ministers that the risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapsing is higher than previously estimated. The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” However, recent research suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. The scientists argue that even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, the potential outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, and therefore more needs to be done to minimize this risk. They believe that the high probability of an AMOC collapse needs to drive more climate action, regardless of whether the collapse happens in the next decades or the next century.\n",

      "A study suggests that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century, despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. The study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios. Although the intensity of the AMOC has declined over time, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change, the authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support their finding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to extreme scenarios, including a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse. Powerful winds in the Southern Ocean that help to drive deep water in the region towards the surface are key to the stability of the AMOC, as they balance out the downwelling in the northern Atlantic. However, the AMOC would collapse if a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation developed and increased the amount of downwelling, although this circulation pattern is too weak to counteract the rising water in the models used.\n",

      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken due to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain, with some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse. Despite this, research across 34 climate models shows that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC, preventing its complete collapse. The AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops, but models show that the PMOC that emerges is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century.\n",

      "A group of 42 climate scientists warned the Nordic Council of Ministers that the risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapsing is higher than previously estimated. The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” However, recent research suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. The scientists argue that even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, the potential outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, and therefore more needs to be done to minimize this risk. They believe that the high probability of an AMOC collapse needs to drive more climate action, regardless of whether the collapse happens in the next decades or the next century.\n",

      "A study suggests that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century, despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. The study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios. Although the intensity of the AMOC has declined over time, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change, the authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support their finding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to extreme scenarios, including a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse. Powerful winds in the Southern Ocean that help to drive deep water in the region towards the surface are key to the stability of the AMOC, as they balance out the downwelling in the northern Atlantic. However, the AMOC would collapse if a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation developed and increased the amount of downwelling, although this circulation pattern is too weak to counteract the rising water in the models used.\n",

      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key component of global climate regulation, is projected to weaken due to global warming but is unlikely to collapse this century. A comprehensive study analyzing 34 climate models under extreme greenhouse gas and freshwater scenarios found that while the AMOC does weaken, it remains resilient. This stability is primarily maintained by persistent Southern Ocean winds that drive upwelling, which must be balanced by downwelling elsewhere—typically in the Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) does emerge in the models, it is too weak to fully offset the Southern Ocean upwelling, preventing a full AMOC shutdown. These findings suggest that while AMOC weakening may still have serious climate consequences, a complete collapse before 2100 is improbable. The study underscores the importance of improving our understanding of Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations to refine future climate predictions.\n",

      "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. However, predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, which have recently been reported for the AMOC, and we estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.\n",

      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken due to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain, with some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse. Despite this, research across 34 climate models shows that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC, preventing its complete collapse. The AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops, but models show that the PMOC that emerges is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century.\n",

      "A group of 42 climate scientists warned the Nordic Council of Ministers that the risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapsing is higher than previously estimated. The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” However, recent research suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. The scientists argue that even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, the potential outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, and therefore more needs to be done to minimize this risk. They believe that the high probability of an AMOC collapse needs to drive more climate action, regardless of whether the collapse happens in the next decades or the next century.\n",

      "A study suggests that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century, despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. The study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios. Although the intensity of the AMOC has declined over time, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change, the authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support their finding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to extreme scenarios, including a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse. Powerful winds in the Southern Ocean that help to drive deep water in the region towards the surface are key to the stability of the AMOC, as they balance out the downwelling in the northern Atlantic. However, the AMOC would collapse if a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation developed and increased the amount of downwelling, although this circulation pattern is too weak to counteract the rising water in the models used.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. Tipping to an undesired state in the climate is, however, a growing concern with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, primarily an increase in variance (loss of resilience) and increased autocorrelation (critical slowing down), which have recently been reported for the AMOC. Here we provide statistical significance and data-driven estimators for the time of tipping. We estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.\n",
      "1. Continued Atlantic overturning circulation even under climate extremes\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse5. Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.\n",
      "2. Scientists warn of collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation AMOC\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of October, 42 climate scientists sent an open letter to the Nordic Council of Ministers, urging them to draw attention to the major ocean circulation change in the Atlantic. “A string of scientific studies in the past few years suggests that this risk has so far been greatly underestimated”, they write.\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapsing is higher than previously estimated, warns a group of 42 climate scientists in their open letter to the Nordic Council of Ministers. The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” This estimation has been challenged by recent research which suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. \n",

And there is even greater likelihood that a collapse is triggered this century but only fully plays out in the next.”, the scientists write. “Given the increasing evidence for a higher risk of an AMOC collapse, we believe it is of critical importance that Arctic tipping point risks, in particular the AMOC risk, are taken seriously in governance and policy”, they write. “Even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, given that the outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, we believe more needs to be done to minimize this risk.””\n",

      "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. However, predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, which have recently been reported for the AMOC, and we estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.\n",

      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken due to global warming, with significant global climate impacts. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain, with some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse. Despite this, research across 34 climate models shows that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC, preventing its complete collapse. The AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops, but models show that the PMOC that emerges is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century.\n",

The AMOC is a system of ocean currents that transports warm water into the North Atlantic and provides Europe its mild climate. The latest IPCC report in 2021 estimated with medium confidence that the AMOC “will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.” However, recent research suggests that the passing of this tipping point is a serious possibility already in the coming decades. The scientists argue that even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, the potential outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, and therefore more needs to be done to minimize this risk.

      "Recent scientific analyses and expert consensus indicate a significantly increased risk of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) within this century due to ongoing global warming. The AMOC, a critical component of the Earth's climate system responsible for transporting warm water to the North Atlantic and moderating Europe's climate, is showing early-warning signals of destabilization—specifically, increased variance and autocorrelation, which suggest a loss of resilience and critical slowing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "A data-driven study estimates that under current greenhouse gas emission trajectories, the AMOC could collapse around mid-century. This assessment is reinforced by an open letter from 42 climate scientists to the Nordic Council of Ministers, emphasizing that the risk has been underestimated and urging immediate attention to this potential tipping point.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the AMOC is expected to face a high probability of collapse within the coming decades if current emission trends continue, posing severe climate risks to the North Atlantic region and beyond.\n",

      "[ Answer text ]\n",
      "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key component of global climate regulation, is projected to weaken due to global warming but is unlikely to collapse this century. A comprehensive study analyzing 34 climate models under extreme greenhouse gas and freshwater scenarios found that while the AMOC does weaken, it remains resilient. This stability is primarily maintained by persistent Southern Ocean winds that drive upwelling, which must be balanced by downwelling elsewhere—typically in the Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) does emerge in the models, it is too weak to fully offset the Southern Ocean upwelling, preventing a full AMOC shutdown. These findings suggest that while AMOC weakening may still have serious climate consequences, a complete collapse before 2100 is improbable. The study underscores the importance of improving our understanding of Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations to refine future climate predictions.\n",
